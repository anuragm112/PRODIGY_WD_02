# PRODIGY_WD_02
The Stopwatch Internship Project is a web-based application that emulates the functionality of a stopwatch. This project was undertaken as part of my internship to enhance my skills in web development and gain hands-on experience in utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
# Features
Start, Stop, and Reset: Users can start and stop the stopwatch's timer. Additionally, a reset button is provided to bring the stopwatch back to its initial state.
Lap Functionality: The stopwatch supports the ability to record laps. Users can record lap times while the timer is running and review them later.
Time Display: The application provides a clear and easy-to-read display of elapsed time, including minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, making it accessible and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
# Technologies Used
HTML: Used to structure the content and define the layout of the application.
CSS: Styled the application, making it visually appealing and ensuring a responsive design.
JavaScript: Implemented the stopwatch logic, including start, stop, reset, and lap functionalities.
